## Fooball transfrer network visualization

Every football season, clubs build up new teams, and fans watch the transfer market with new hopes for the upcoming season. Transfers play a crucial role in shaping teams' fortunes, making the transfer market a focal point of excitement and speculation. 

This [project](https://github.com/PerezCorrea/football_transfer_analysis) visualizes the network of football transfers among clubs in the top 5 European leagues: the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1. 

The project aims to:
1. Data Collection: Gather transfer data from relevant sources.
2. Data Cleaning: Process and clean the collected data.
3. Visualization: Create an interactive network visualization to display the transfers.

## Spot the Crop from the Top

This [project](https://github.com/AIMPED/NF-Capstone-Crop-Classification) is the competition [Radiant Earth Spot the Crop XL Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/radiant-earth-spot-the-crop-xl-challenge) on the Zindi community website. 

The competition consists in predicting the crop type of agricultural cultivation fields in South Africa, specifically in the Western Cape. The necessary data has been provided by the competition owner.
