### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Juan
I am a curious, hard-working and fast learning person fascinated by the power of the data to change the world. As a Mechanical Design Engineer I have proven my problem-solving, creativity and teamwork skills. I am now seeking to use my deep Python and machine learning knowledge in a Data Science role.
